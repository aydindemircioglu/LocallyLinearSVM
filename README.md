Locally Linear SVM
================

this is a commandline Wrapper for LocallyLinearSVM by Ladicky and Torr.
unluckily their code is missing any command line and furthermore the model
is not saved, so it is not useable. i have added a command line (stolen partly
from LIBSVM) and furthermore made a LIBSVM-like mode file. I have tested
it with two data files, it seems to work properly.

the licence of the original code is not specified, as such i assume it is either
public domain or BSD. my contributions are licenced by LGPL. if you apply
changes to the code, please make your changes public.
